## 🔰 Mission: Rewrite Reality

**Oracle** is a next-gen **All-in-One** Discord bot built with **Discord.js** (Node.js).

**The Objective:**
Stop cluttering your server with dozens of single-purpose, premium-locked bots. Oracle's mission is to provide **one** stylish, free, and powerful "Palace" manager that covers everything: from 24/7 atmosphere to security.

Heavily inspired by Futaba Sakura (*Persona 5 Royal*), Oracle brings the Phantom Thieves aesthetic directly to your community.
